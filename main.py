    Entrypoint of this program.

    Adopting ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` pattern and defining ``main()`` function
    simultaneously is **VERY** necessary.

    1. We use :var:`__name__` variable to detect whether the current module is executed
    as a script, not imported as lib.

    2. If we don't define the ``main`` function, any variable declared in the ``if``
    statement will become **GLOBAL**. That may cause some covert errors and bugs.

    Additionally, the `main()` function should not receive any arguments. Startup
    arguments should be written in configuration files.

# This is VERY necessary to both adopting ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` pattern and
