# Alibaba Crawler Plus
Crawler project inherited from postgraduate seniors.

> This project is heading to V2. For legacy codes and commits, see [legacy](https://github.com/cylixlee/alibaba_crawlerplus/tree/legacy).
>
> In V2, we use [scrapy](https://scrapy.org) as the crawler framework, and abandoned lots of non-practical source. Using the existing mature framework is more beneficial than the handwritten one, let alone the very legacy version.

This project adopts [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as package & venv manager. For more detail, see [the official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
